## Sales Prediction Using Python Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Python to predict future sales based on historical data and relevant features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, 
the goal is to analyze and interpret data to provide actionable insights for businesses. Predicting future sales is crucial for strategic planning and decision-making in businesses offering products or services.
This project provides a framework to build a predictive model that can help businesses optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for this project is the advertising dataset, which contains 200 records with  columns TV	,Radio,	Newspaper, and	Sales.
Use the advertising dataset analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple linear regression model.

## Requirements

Python 3.x

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

Seaborn

numpy

Jupyter Notebook

## Approach

1. Data Collection:
Gather historical data on sales, advertising expenditure and advertising platform selection.
Ensure the data is comprehensive and representative of different scenarios.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Given advertising data was already clean data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.
Visualize the data using plots and charts to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
Gain insights into the factors influencing sales and their interactions.

4. Model Selection:
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for sales prediction.
Consider algorithm like linear regression which is suitable for this data.

5. Model Training:
Split the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.
Train the selected machine learning model on the training data.

6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared.
Compare the model's performance against baseline models or industry benchmarks.

7. Prediction and Deployment:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or future sales.
Deploy the model in a production environment to generate real-time predictions.
Monitor the model's performance and update it periodically to adapt to changing business conditions.

8. Interpretation and Actionable Insights:
Interpret the model's results and understand the factors driving sales predictions.
Provide actionable insights to stakeholders to optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.
Continuously analyze and refine the model to improve its accuracy and relevance over time.
